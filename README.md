This project encompasses a fully functional chemical reactor simulator that can size and compute intersatge feeding rates of membrane reactors and a system of PFRs.
Iterative solutions are computed using an RK4-Fehlberg method contained in RK4Package.
PFRPackage is responsiible for modelling intrinsic species data and specified PFR behaviour. A permutation algorithm is used to simulation various interstage feed rates
into each reactor if ineterstage feeding of a reactant is required.
